# Chattie - Your chatting buddy

## 📝 Problem Statement
In today’s digital world, users expect quick and natural interactions with machines.  
Traditional rule-based chatbots often feel rigid and fail to understand varied inputs.  
The problem this project addresses is: **How can we build a simple chatbot that feels more human-like without requiring complex training or large datasets?**  
By using a pre-trained NLP model (spaCy), we aim to detect user intent more intelligently and provide meaningful responses.

## 📌 Scope of the Project
- Build a modular chatbot in Python that uses **pre-trained NLP** for intent detection.  
- Demonstrate conversational AI concepts in a way that is approachable for academic projects.  
- Keep the system lightweight, easy to run, and extensible for future improvements (e.g., adding APIs for weather or knowledge retrieval).  
- Provide clear documentation, logging, and examples so the project can be understood and tested by educators and peers.

## 🎯 Target Users
- **Students and educators** who want to learn about AI and NLP basics.  
- **Beginners in Python** who want to see how modular programming can be applied in real projects.  
- **Academic evaluators** who need a clear, working demonstration of conversational AI.  
- Anyone curious about how chatbots can respond to everyday queries like greetings, jokes, or simple math.

## ✨ High-Level Features
- **Intent detection** using spaCy’s pre-trained English model.  
- **Dynamic responses** for greetings, farewells, thanks, and help requests.  
- **Time and date replies** using Python’s datetime module.  
- **Fun interactions** like jokes and random facts.  
- **Safe calculator** for basic math expressions.  
- **Academic explanations** (e.g., definition of Artificial Intelligence).  
- **Conversation logging** for audit trails and project evaluation.  
- **Weather placeholder** (future scope: integrate with an API).
